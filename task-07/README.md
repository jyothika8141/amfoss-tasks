# **Go WASM**

I found this task to be the most challenging one. I was very new to concept web assembly and neither did I know golang. It took me a few days to understand the concepts.

<br>
The problem I faced was not being able to call the required function from the main.wasm file. It took me a sometime to figure out the "syscall/js" package, after which I was able complete the task.
